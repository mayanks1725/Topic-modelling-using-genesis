TITLE: Coordination in Large-Scale Agile Software Development

ABSTRACT: Agile practices are popular within software development. But when applied to large projects with many teams, coordination challenges arise. The projects working title “Coordination in large-scale agile software development: An investigation of coordination mechanisms, communication, roles, autonomy and interdependencies” summarizes the main topics of investigation. While all theoretical and analytical approaches to the data material is not yet determined, I have already started fieldwork in one company which will serve as a main longitudinal case, with more to follow as the project proceeds. Initial fieldwork has revealed that there are differences in how agile teams coordinate their work across teams. I will continue to explore these differences. End goals of the project include to identify success criteria for coordination in large-scale agile software development projects.
