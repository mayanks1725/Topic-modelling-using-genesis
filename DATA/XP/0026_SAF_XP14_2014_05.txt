TITLE: A Model for Understanding When Scaling Agile Is Appropriate in Large Organizations

ABSTRACT: The term “agile at scale” is used frequently in relation to agile approaches in large organizations, but the meaning of “scale” is not always clear. Without a proper understanding of meaning and context, inappropriate methods are applied. It is important to understand when “scaling agile” is the solution to the problem at hand, and when its not. There is a difference between agile approaches used by a team in a large organization, agile approaches used on a large development effort, and organization agility. The distinction is important. This paper explores that distinction using Human Systems Dynamics as a lens through which to understand and articulate which of the three contexts an organization is dealing with. By analyzing a system through the HSD lens it becomes possible to predict and influence the impact on the flow of work through the system, and in particular, it is possible to understand what types of impediments might impact the flow of work. This helps organizations to understand appropriate approaches to agility that better suit their context.
