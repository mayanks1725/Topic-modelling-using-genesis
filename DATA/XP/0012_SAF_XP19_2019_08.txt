TITLE: Comparing Scaling Agile Frameworks Based on Underlying Practices

ABSTRACT: Context: Agile software development is widely-used by small teams and has benefits like increased transparency or faster feedback. However, companies want to benefit from Agile also in the development of big products, where multiple teams are involved. Many Scaling Agile Frameworks exist, but only few can be found in industry, especially SAFe, LeSS, and Nexus. Objective: The aim of this work is to identify commonalities of existing Scaling Agile Frameworks concerning their practices. Method: We extracted and consolidated the practices of twelve frameworks and compared the frameworks based on their practices using a visualization. Results: Frameworks prescribe scaling practices as well as practices on team level. There are practices common to most frameworks like the scaled Scrum events, e.g., a scaled planning meeting or retrospective. Conclusion: Practitioners are enabled to make informed decisions when choosing or tailoring their individual Scaling Agile Framework.
