TITLE: Future Trends in Agile at Scale: A Summary of the 7th International Workshop on Large-Scale Agile Development

ABSTRACT: This workshop explored the main research challenges in conducting agile software development in large-scale software development. We considered multi-site companies with projects that include a large number of teams which develop sophisticated systems by adopting and using agile methods. Such topics include inter-team coordination, knowledge sharing, agile transformations, and project management models that facilitate multiple cooperating self-organising teams. The keynote talk, by Darja Åœmite, provided empirical results on communities of practice within the music streaming service Spotify. We accepted five full research papers which are included in this volume. These five papers report empirical research studies using surveys, observational and case studies. Workshop participants also worked together in groups to establish current research topics and priorities. This workshop summary contributes a current snapshot of research along with future research agendas in the field of large-scale agile development.
