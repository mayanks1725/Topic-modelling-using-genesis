TITLE: Quantitatively measuring a large-scale agile transformation

ABSTRACT: 
Context: Agile software development continues to grow in popularity and is being adopted by more and more organizations. However, there is a need for empirical evidence on the impact, benefits and drawbacks of an agile transformation in an organization since the cost for such a transformation in terms of money, disrupted working routines and quality of development can become considerable. Currently, such evidence exists in the form of success stores and case studies, mostly of qualitative nature.

Objective: Provide a metrics model to quantitatively measure the impact of an agile transformation in a software development organization.

Method: The metrics model was elicited with the use of the Goal Question Metric approach.

Results: A quantitative metrics model containing eight rigorously described metrics is presented and followed by its application to evaluate an agile and lean transformation in a large international telecommunication organization with 350 employees in two sites.

Conclusions: The metrics model was sensitive to the changes that occurred in the organization and revealed significant improvements in six of the eight metrics and a deterioration in one of the metrics.
